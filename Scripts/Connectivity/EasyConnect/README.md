# The script is to assist ISP/WISP field technicians to configure Mikrotik routers after initial installation.
# Keep it simple, objective is to get the router online as quickly as possible with minimal user input.

# You can either create a script and paste the contents of easy-assist-source.rsc, or paste the file directly onto the router. Then run the script from terminal.
# Alternatively and also the easier way, paste the contents of easy-assist-run-in-terminal.rsc directly into a terminal. This will create the script and run it for you.
# If there are any issues with the script, please let me know and I will sort them out. Enjoy.
